                <p>Editors offer several features that Notepad canâ€™t. Features that a professional editors can offer are listed below</p>
                <div class="box">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Syntax Highlighting:</strong>Highlighting the tags, attributes will help us to verify the code visually.</li>
                        <li><strong>Code Validation:</strong>This is the most required feature that a notepad misses, it will indicate the incorrect syntax and missing tags, incorrect attribute or quote for any attribute value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Autocompletion:</strong>Autocompletion saves a lot of time to write the basic things like a dummy HTML structure, or multiple element requirements, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging Tools:</strong>A few HTML editors provide debugging tools to debug the code but in HTML there is no such scenario where it may be required. Because we have code validation that will help us to maintain the code if we make any incorrect move.</li>
                    </ul>
